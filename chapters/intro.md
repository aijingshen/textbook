# Introduction to Biomedicine for Engineers

This course introduces undergraduates to the types of problems that bioengineers solve and the concepts they apply to solve them. Various types of devices - from genetically engineered bacteria to biosensors - will be discussed, and we will explore the physics and biology necessary to understand and design each device. In addition, students will learn how to work effectively in groups and communicate their results professionally. While this syllabus is meant to accurately describe the course and its content, it may be modified at the instructorâ€™s discretion.
